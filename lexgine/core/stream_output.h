    //! Exact meaning depends on the underlying API. name_index is index coupled with the string name when more then one stream outputs are using the
    //! same string name, again specific meaning relies on the graphics API.
    //! Note that name can be nullptr, in which case the entry defines gap in output stream where no data will be written; the size of this gap is
    //! defined by component_count that otherwise should be not greater than 4.
    //! start_component is the start vertex component at which the output should begin writing. Valid values are from 0 to 3.
    //! component_count is number of vertex components, to which to perform the output beginning from start_component.
    //! Valid values are from 1 to 4 (until name is not nullptr).
    //! slot is zero-based index of output buffer bound to the pipeline. The valid range is from 0 to 3.
