<!-- This code snippet demonstrates example of graphics PSO descriptor serialized to XML format.
This serialization is heavily tailored to Direct3D 12 and its main purpose is to operate as 
a mediator between the runtime backend and more high-level API-agnostic XML description of 
materials. Note that all sections under <GraphicsPSO> </GraphicsPSO> and <ComputePSO> </ComputePSO>
can be stated only once until explicitly mentioned otherwise. In contrast to this, it IS allowed 
to have several pipeline state definitions within the same XML script, in which case the backend

Each graphics PSO may define a number of attributes, all of which are optional.
"name"    descriptive string name of the graphics PSO. This attribute is optional; if not provided, the system assigns auto-generated value
"primitive_restart"    when equals 'TRUE' primitive restart is enabled. Default is 'FALSE'
"primitive_topology"    primitive topology assumed by the primitive assembler. Allowed values are predefined keywords POINT, LINE, TRIANGLE, PATCH. Default is TRIANGLE
"sample_mask"    mask applied to the sub-pixel samples when multi-sampling is enabled. Default is 0xFFFFFFFF, which means that all samples are in use.
"sample_count"    number of samples. Default is "1", which means no MSAA.
"sample_quality"    quality of multi-sampling. The maximal value supported by this attribute is determined by graphics driver. Usually on modern hardware the only supported 
                    value is 0 and this is also the default value for this attribute. Therefore, using of this attribute is not recommended and it's better to omit it altogether
                    thus effectively falling back to the default.

This entry has the following attributes, all of which are optional:

"fill_mode" defines primitive filling mode and can be assigned to either SOLID or WIREFRAME, both of which are predefined keywords.
The default value is SOLID.

"cull_mode" defines the culling mode and can be assigned to FRONT (cull the front facing polygones), BACK (cull the back facing polygones),
or NONE (disables culling). The default values is BACK.

"front_face_winding" defines, which vertex winding to consider as the hint for "front facing" polygone. The attribute can be 
CLOCKWISE (vertices listed in clockwise order are considered to define a front facing polygone) or COUNTERCLOCKWISE (vertices 
listed in counter clockwise order produce front facing polygones). Default value is COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

"depth_clip" determines if z-clipping is enabled. Can be TRUE or FALSE. Default is TRUE.

"line_anti_aliasing" enables anti-aliased line drawing when TRUE. This has effect only when drawing lines. Default is FALSE.

"multi_sampling" enables quadrilateral anti-aliasing on MSAA render targets when TRUE. Default is FALSE. When this attribute is TRUE
this forces the attibute "line_anti_aliasing" to FALSE.

<!-- Depth-stencil descriptor is used to define functionality of the depth and stencil tests. There could be only one depth stencil
descriptor per pipeline definition. Depth-stencil descriptors support the following attributes:

"enable_depth_test" controls enable state of the depth test. Can be TRUE or FALSE. The default is TRUE.

"allow_depth_writes" when FALSE, the values that pass the depth test will not be written into the depth buffer. The default is TRUE, which allows
depth buffer updates.

"depth_test_comparison_function" defines comparison function used by the depth test. This attribute may be assigned to one of the following predefined
values:
    NEVER (never pass the comparison),
    LESS (passes if source data is less then destination data),
    EQUAL (passes if source data is equal to destination data),
    LESS_OR_EQUAL (passes if source data is less than or equal to the destination data),
    GREATER (passes if source data is greater than destination data),
    NOT_EQUAL (passes if source data is not equal to the destination data),
    GREATER_EQUAL (passes if source data is greater than or equal to the destination data),
    ALWAYS (depth test always passes)
The defaults value for depth_test_comparison_function is LESS

"enable_stencil_test" controls enable state of the stencil test. The default is FALSE, which means that the stencil test is disabled.

"stencil_read_mask" integer single-byte value in range from 0x0 to 0xFF, which identifies the portion of the stencil buffer, from which to
extract the stencil data. Using this attribute only makes sence when depth and stencil data are packed together. The default is 0xFF.

"stencil_write_mask" integer single-byte value in range from 0x0 to 0xFF, which identifies to which portion of the stencil buffer the stencil
data will be written. Using this attribute only makes sence when depth and stencil data are packed together. The default is 0xFF.


Depth stencil descriptor supports child entries called "StencilTestBehavior". There can be at most two such entries 
determining behavior of stencil test as applies to front and back polygone faces, i.e. one entry can define 
behavior for the front faces and one entry — for the back faces. Listing multiple entries defining different behavior for
same polygone faces makes no sense (technically it is still possible, but only the last declatations will take effect). 
Each StencilTestBehavior entry supports the following attributes:

"face" can be either FRONT or BACK and determines to which polygone faces this behavior applies

"comparison_function" determines comparison function of the stencil test and can be one of the following predefined
tokens:

    NEVER (never pass the comparison),
    LESS (passes if source data is less then destination data),
    EQUAL (passes if source data is equal to destination data),
    LESS_OR_EQUAL (passes if source data is less than or equal to the destination data),
    GREATER (passes if source data is greater than destination data),
    NOT_EQUAL (passes if source data is not equal to the destination data),
    GREATER_EQUAL (passes if source data is greater than or equal to the destination data),
    ALWAYS (depth test always passes)
This attribute is optional and defaults to ALWAYS
	
"operation_st_fail" determines action performed on the stencil buffer when stencil test fails.
This attribute may take on of the following tokens:

    KEEP (keep existing data),
    ZERO (set stencil data to zero),
    REPLACE (replace stencil data with reference value),
    INCREMENT_AND_SATURATE (increment currently stored stencil value by one and clamp the result),
    DECREMENT_AND_SATURATE (decrement currently stored stencil value by one and clamp the result)
    INVERT (invert stencil data, i.e. inverse the bit order),
    INCREMENT (increment current stencil value),
    DECREMENT (decrement current stencil value)
Default value for this attribute is "KEEP"

"operation_st_pass_dt_fail" determines action performed on the stencil buffer when depth test fails and stencil test passes.
This attribute accepts values from the same predefined set as "operation_st_fail". The attribute is optional and defaults to "KEEP"

"operation_st_pass_dt_pass" determines action performed on the stencil buffer when both depth and stencil tests are passed.
This attribute accepts values from the same predefined set as "operation_st_fail". The attribute is optional and defaults to "KEEP"
    
"dsv_target_format" identifies DXGI format to be used by the depth-stencil target. One of the following predefined 
values is allowed:

    DXGI_FORMAT_D32_FLOAT_S8X24_UINT

<!--
Each vertex attribute define name and index semantics. For example, if string semantics of certain attribute is "MyAttribute" and index is 5, then
the correspoding input attribute in HLSL shader will be identified by "MyAttribute5" semantics. In addition to semantics properties vertex attribute must
define the size (i.e. the number of components) of the attribute, its type and whether the data in the attribute is stored in normalized format. For the size 
supported values are 1, 2, 3, or 4. Type can get on the following predefined values: FLOAT16 (half-precision floats), FLOAT32, INT16, INT32, UINT16, or UINT32.
The "normalized" attribute is optional and defaults to FALSE. 

Finally, optional attribute "instancing_rate" identifies whether the data in the corresponding vertex buffer should be instances and how many draw calls are made
before advancing one element in the buffer. Wher instancing_rate is 0, the data in the buffer is not instanced. The default value for this attribute is 0, which
means that no instancing is applied by default.

<!--
Render target descriptor defines output render target of the PSO. Up to 8 render targets can be defined within single PSO. Each render 
target is attached to an output slot indexed from 0 to 7. The output slot is determined by the "slot" attribute of the RenderTarget specifier. 
Note that there can be no two render targets sharing the same output slot.
Besides the "slot" attribute render targets also support attribute "format", which is one of DXGI formats allowed to be used with the render targets.
More precisely, "format" can get one of the following predefined keywords (some other are also allowed, but those listed below can be used most safely;
