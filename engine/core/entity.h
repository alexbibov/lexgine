//! Note also that the types exlicitly residing in lexgine::core (i.e. lexgine::core::BlendDescriptor) do never derive from this type.
//! Naturally, this object is OS-agnostic
//! Note that classes with name Window located in lexgine::osinteraction also for now derive from this type (this is subject to change in the future as these classes are tailored to
//! each supported operating system and will be abstracted by an OS-agnostic class Window located in lexgine::core)
